Dear Superintendent Yao, Associate Superintendent Ghelber, Principal Van Gorden, and CUSD Board Trustees,

I urge you to take immediate action regarding the inclusion of political symbols in the McAuliffe School yearbook before distribution occurs.

Your own policies and applicable legal precedents are clear on this matter:

1. CUSD Board Policy 4119.25 explicitly prohibits political activities of employees while on duty
2. California Education Code § 7050-7058 restricts political activities of school officers and employees
3. California Education Code § 51101.7 requires a school environment that is "safe and supporting of learning"
4. California Education Code § 49091.12(a) protects students from having to "affirm or disavow any particular personally or privately held world view, religious doctrine, or political opinion"
5. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits creating a hostile environment based on race, ethnicity, or national origin

As established in CDE Case Matter 2025-0008 (Campbell), what adult staff members observe is not definitive evidence of how political symbols affect students. This precedent recognizes that students' experiences must be centered when assessing hostile environments.

Allowing political symbols in the yearbook:
1. Directly contradicts your own policies
2. Creates an unwelcoming environment for Jewish and Israeli students
3. Establishes a permanent record of political messaging in an official school publication
4. Sets a concerning precedent for future political expressions in school environments

You have both the authority and responsibility to act on this matter NOW, independent of any ongoing investigation. The distribution of yearbooks is imminent, making this issue time-critical.

Please fulfill your responsibility to protect children from political agendas by taking one of these straightforward actions:
- Replace the class photo
- Edit the image to remove political symbols
- Insert an alternative class photo

I respectfully request your immediate attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[SIGN YOUR NAME HERE]
