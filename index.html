    <h1>Take Action: Remove Political Symbols from McAuliffe Yearbook</h1>
    
    <p class="urgent">URGENT: Yearbooks are about to be distributed with political symbols that violate district policies</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Political symbols in the yearbook create a permanent record that affects Jewish and Israeli students and families. District policies prohibit political expressions by employees, yet these symbols are about to appear in an official school publication.</p>
