CUSD Board Policy 4119.25 explicitly prohibits political activities of employees while on duty%0A2. California Education Code ยง 7050-7058 restricts political activities of school officers and employees%0A3. California Education Code ยง 51101.7 requires a school environment that is 'safe and supporting of learning'%0A4. California Education Code ยง 49091.12(a) protects students from having to 'affirm or disavow any particular personally or privately held world view, religious doctrine, or political opinion'%0A5. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits creating a hostile environment based on race, ethnicity, or national origin%0A%0AAs established in CDE Case Matter 2025-0008 (Campbell), what adult staff members observe is not definitive evidence of how political symbols affect students. This precedent recognizes that students' experiences must be centered when assessing hostile environments.%0A%0AAllowing political symbols in the yearbook:%0A1. Directly contradicts your own policies%0A2. Creates an unwelcoming environment for Jewish and Israeli students%0A3. Establishes a permanent record of political messaging in an official school publication%0A4. Sets a concerning precedent for future political expressions in school environments%0A%0AYou have both the authority and responsibility to act on this matter NOW, independent of any ongoing investigation. The distribution of yearbooks is imminent, making this issue time-critical.%0A%0APlease fulfill your responsibility to protect children from political agendas by taking one of these straightforward actions:%0A- Replace the class photo%0A- Edit the image to remove political symbols%0A- Insert an alternative class photo%0A%0AI respectfully request your immediate attention to this matter.%0A%0ASincerely,%0A[SIGN YOUR NAME HERE]%0AConcerned CUSD Community Member"
